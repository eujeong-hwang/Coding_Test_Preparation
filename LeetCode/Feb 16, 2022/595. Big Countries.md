https://leetcode.com/problems/big-countries/

## Question

    Table: World

    +-------------+---------+
    | Column Name | Type    |
    +-------------+---------+
    | name        | varchar |
    | continent   | varchar |
    | area        | int     |
    | population  | int     |
    | gdp         | int     |
    +-------------+---------+
    name is the primary key column for this table.
    Each row of this table gives information about the name of a country, the continent to which it belongs, its area, the population, and its GDP value.

<br>

    A country is big if:

    it has an area of at least three million (i.e., 3000000 km2), or
    it has a population of at least twenty-five million (i.e., 25000000).
    Write an SQL query to report the name, population, and area of the big countries.

    Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

## Example

    Input: 
    World table:
    +-------------+-----------+---------+------------+--------------+
    | name        | continent | area    | population | gdp          |
    +-------------+-----------+---------+------------+--------------+
    | Afghanistan | Asia      | 652230  | 25500100   | 20343000000  |
    | Albania     | Europe    | 28748   | 2831741    | 12960000000  |
    | Algeria     | Africa    | 2381741 | 37100000   | 188681000000 |
    | Andorra     | Europe    | 468     | 78115      | 3712000000   |
    | Angola      | Africa    | 1246700 | 20609294   | 100990000000 |
    +-------------+-----------+---------+------------+--------------+
    Output: 
    +-------------+------------+---------+
    | name        | population | area    |
    +-------------+------------+---------+
    | Afghanistan | 25500100   | 652230  |
    | Algeria     | 37100000   | 2381741 |
    +-------------+------------+---------+

## MySQL query statement
```
SELECT name, population, area
FROM world
WHERE area > 3000000
UNION
SELECT name, population, area
FROM world
WHERE population > 25000000;
```

```
SELECT World.name, World.population, World.area
FROM World
WHERE World.area >= 3000000 OR World.population >= 25000000;
```

## ??

Used >= as a notation of representing 'at least'. But in the solution it is presented as '>'. 
Its Very ~ confusing.
