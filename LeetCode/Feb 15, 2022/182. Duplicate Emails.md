    | Column Name | Type    |
    +-------------+---------+
    | id          | int     |
    | email       | varchar |
    +-------------+---------+

    Write an SQL query to report all the duplicate emails.

    Return the result table in any order.

    The query result format is in the following example.

    Person table:
    +----+---------+
    | id | email   |
    +----+---------+
    | 1  | a@b.com |
    | 2  | c@d.com |
    | 3  | a@b.com |
    +----+---------+
    Output: 
    +---------+
    | Email   |
    +---------+
    | a@b.com |
    +---------+
    Explanation: a@b.com is repeated two times.

## MySQL code

SELECT Person.email
FROM Person
GROUP BY Person.email
HAVING COUNT(Person.email) > 1;
```
