https://leetcode.com/problems/rising-temperature/

## Question

    Table: Weather

    +---------------+---------+
    | Column Name   | Type    |
    +---------------+---------+
    | id            | int     |
    | recordDate    | date    |
    | temperature   | int     |
    +---------------+---------+
    id is the primary key for this table.
    This table contains information about the temperature on a certain day.

<br>

    Write an SQL query to find all dates' Id with higher temperatures compared to its previous dates (yesterday).

    Return the result table in any order.

    The query result format is in the following example.

## Example

    Input: 
    Weather table:
    +----+------------+-------------+
    | id | recordDate | temperature |
    +----+------------+-------------+
    | 1  | 2015-01-01 | 10          |
    | 2  | 2015-01-02 | 25          |
    | 3  | 2015-01-03 | 20          |
    | 4  | 2015-01-04 | 30          |
    +----+------------+-------------+
    Output: 
    +----+
    | id |
    +----+
    | 2  |
    | 4  |
    +----+
    Explanation: 
    In 2015-01-02, the temperature was higher than the previous day (10 -> 25).
    In 2015-01-04, the temperature was higher than the previous day (20 -> 30).

## MySQL query statement
```
SELECT a.Id
FROM Weather as a, Weather as b 
WHERE a.temperature > b.temperature AND DATEDIFF(a.recordDate, b.recordDate) = 1
```

## What I Learned

```
DATEDIFF() clause

MySQL uses DATEDIFF to compare two date type values.

So, we can get the result by joining this table weather with itself and use this DATEDIFF() function.
